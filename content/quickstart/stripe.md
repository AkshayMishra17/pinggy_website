With [pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) you can test your Stripe Webhook from localhost with just a single command. **Replace the port 8080 with the port where your webhook is running and make sure the webhook is ready to receive requests (e.g. http://localhost:8080/webhooks).**

Pinggy will give you a URL like `https://ranlkfsbjkxry.a.pinggy.io`. Use this URL to access the webhook.
